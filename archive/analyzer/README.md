# Analyzer

This is a set of R scripts to reproduce the analysis of the paper "Alberto Avritzer, Vincenzo Ferme, Andrea Janes, Barbara Russo, Andr√© van Hoorn, Henning Schulz, Daniel Menasch, Vilc Rufino, "Scalability Assessment of Microservice Architectural Configurations:A Domain-based Approach Leveraging Operational Profiles and Load Tests"

Execute the script start.R to run the analysis.

The tool performe the following steps:

- Compute the operational profile of a system either from frequency counts or from accesses
- Compute the baseline threshold
- Compute the domain metric for each configuration and each load
- Rank configurations by the total domain metric summed over loads
- Plot polygons
- Compute the sensitivity analysis on the threshold variation
- Plot the the sensitivity analysis over threshold variation and compute the gap to operational profile
