                    LighttpdService Sample README

The LighttpdService sample provides a very simple example for organizing a Faban
service project as well as how to write a new service. It is a good starting
point to copy the directory from this sample to create your new service.

Notes:
- The sbin directory contains utilities to run a benchmark outside
  the Faban harness. This will not be packaged into the deployment
  jar files. Services/tools-specific scripts and binaries should be placed
  into the bin directory.

- The deploy directory contains the files services-tools.xml and toolsets.xml.
  service-tools.xmls has list services and the tools to run for that service.
  toolsets.xml has the list of toolsets.

- The service project consists of a single service class - LighttpdService.java
  that is responsible for configuring, starting and stopping the service. There
  can be many tools associated with this service. 

- If you need to change the default deployment system, edit build.properties.
  To deploy, simply type 'ant deploy'. This will build and deploy the service
  to the target faban master.
