                    Hadoop README

This is a Hadoop benchmark using FABAN. We provide a wrapper
around the yahoo gridmix benchmark as is - without changing the way the
benchmark is run in any way as well as the ability to run your own classes.

Notes:
- The sbin directory contains utilities to run a benchmark outside
  the Faban harness. This will not be packaged into the deployment
  jar files. Benchmark-specific scripts and binaries should be places
  into the bin directory.

- The deploy directory contains the files used for the UI. Any changes to the
  UI need to go here (e.g. adding additional user parameters).

- The benchmark consists of a single class - HadoopGridMix.java which is the
  harness hook. It implements the configure, start and end methods, replacing
  these from DefaultFabanBenchmark.

- If you need to change the default deployment system, edit build.properties.
  To deploy, simply type 'ant deploy'. This will build and deploy the benchmark
  to the target faban master.
