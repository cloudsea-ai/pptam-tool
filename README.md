# Tool for Production and Performance Testing Based Application Monitoring (pptam)

## Installation

The installation assumes the following setup:

- one machine controls the test execution (this machine is called the "driver") and 
- one machine is the one on which a software is tested, i.e., it contains the "software under test" and is called "test".

During the use of pptam, the driver machine executes tests on the test machine, collects the results, and visualizes them.

To setup this environment, it is possible to use real machines or to simulate the setup using virtual machines. The detailed installation instruction can be found in the file [Installation.md](Installation.md), in which we use [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html) to setup the two machines.
